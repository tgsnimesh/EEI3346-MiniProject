<h2>Understanding Water Pollution.</h2>
<p>Water pollution happens when harmful things like chemicals, trash, and sewage get into rivers, lakes, and oceans, making the water dirty and unsafe for plants, animals, and people. It's a big 
problem because clean water is essential for drinking, swimming, and supporting life. Protecting our waterways from pollution is crucial for the health of our environment and communities.</p>

<h2>Navigating Urban Wetland Park Water Pollutio.</h2> 
<p>I've selected Nugegoda Urban Wetland Park canal as my focus, particularly concerning water pollution. Let's delve into the intricate 
challenges posed by pollution in this vital waterway, exploring its causes, impacts, and potential solutions.</p>

</br>
</br>
<h2>Sub Problems.</h2>
 
<h4>1. Stagnant Water. </h4>
<p>The absence of proper water movement mechanisms allows 
pollutants to accumulate and stagnate in the lake. This stagnant 
condition facilitates the growth of algae and bacteria, further 
deteriorating water quality. </p>
 
<h4>2. Human Waste and Debris. </h4>
<p>Despite the park's natural beauty, visitors often contribute to 
pollution by littering plastics and garbage into the lake. </p>
 
<h4>3. Direct Discharge. </h4>
<p>Surrounding homes and businesses may unknowingly contribute to 
water pollution by directing their wastewater or drainage systems 
directly into the lake.</p>

<h2>Used web technologies and examples.</h2>

<h4>1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h4>
<p><b>Description</b>: HTML is used for structuring the content of web 
pages. It defines the layout and organization of elements such as 
headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. </p>
<p><b>Examples</b>: I utilized HTML to create the structure of my 
website, including elements like headers, navigation bars, 
content sections, and footers. </p>

<h4>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h4>
<p><b>Description</b>: CSS is used for styling the appearance of web 
pages. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual 
presentation of HTML elements. </p>
<p><b>Examples</b>: I applied CSS to apply styles and design elements to 
my website, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive look 
across all pages. This includes setting colors, fonts, margins, 
padding, and other visual properties.</p>

<h4>3. JavaScript (JS)</h4>
<p><b>Description</b>: JavaScript is a programming language that adds 
interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows you to 
manipulate HTML elements, handle user events, and create 
responsive features.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b>: I've used JavaScript to implement interactive features 
on my website. </p>

<h4>4. VueJS</h4>
<p><b>Description</b>:  Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for 
building user interfaces. It enables the creation of reactive and 
dynamic web applications with ease.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b>:  I've integrated Vue.js into my website to create dynamic 
components such as the navigation bar, footer, and feedback 
section. By using Vue.js, Iâ€™ve simplified the management of these 
components and added interactivity to my website.</p>
<p>Ex : </p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigation bar</li>
  <li>Upcomming Events </li>
  <li>Comment Section</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interactive Features Testing </h2>
<p><b>Test Case</b>: Test interactive features such as the scroll-up 
button, image gallery popup, and feedback form. </p>
<p><b>Description</b>: I evaluated interactive features like the scroll-up 
button, image gallery popup, and feedback form to ensure 
smooth functionality. By testing these elements, I confirmed they 
provide a seamless user experience, enhancing engagement on
